    <string name="openRcSummary">OpenRC is a modified version of the ftc_app software created by members of the OpenFTC
        community. The goal of OpenRC is to improve the development experience for teams, while providing a quick-and-easy
        path to install a competition-legal version of the app. \n\nThe GDC has ruled that OpenRC is not legal for
        competition use, and a user acknowledged this fact the first time they launched this app.\n\nFor more information
        about OpenRC and the OpenFTC community responsible for it, please see http://openftc.org/OpenRC</string>
